The datasets used in this presentation were from Office for National Statistics and represent Gross Value added in terms of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). More information on NUTS3 can be found here.
The second dataset used in this presentation is from The Best Place to Live as a Young Adult, evaluated by Comparethemarket. For the full dataset, the link can be found here 

For this project, I first used Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape the data of their respective web pages.

Then, I used Python to aggregate summary statistics within Jupyter Notebook. In doing so, I discovered. 

Which regions have the highest proportion of young adults?
Which regions have the highest 4G coverage?
What was the average score per region?
Which regions and cities spend the highest proportion of their salary on rent?
Which variables have the highest correlation with Mental wellbeing?

After this, I wanted to focus more on the economic output of each region. To achieve this, I performed an inner join to merge the tables into a single dataframe. I wanted to discover, 

Does a higher value of rent correlate with a higher gross value added per head?
Is there a correlation between the Young adult percentage and productivity of a city?
Are cities with a higher Gross Value added ranked as better for young adults?
